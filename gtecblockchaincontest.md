# Product / Idea


## Describe your project and the problem it solves

Internet services suffer from centralization which hinders innovation.
We develop open source platform for uncensorable uncensorable 
and decentralised services, such as social networks or messenging, which
would be available in some sort of decentralized marketplace ("app store").
For the beginning we'll start with Social Network, Group Decision and Finances.

## What stage is your company/product in?

Development

## Which blockchain do you use, and why does it help to solve your problem?

We develop custom per-app blockchains over  IPFS.

IPFS provides p2p reliable network storage and communication with
immutable data and ability to route around filters.

# Team

## Where do you live now, and where is the team based?

Me - Kyiv, Ukraine

Project team will be distributed

## How many people are in your team, and what do they do?

Me + my software development team from 42 Coffee Cups


# Users

## What existing solutions are there for this problem?

Uncensorable app protocols:

* DarkNet:  TOR, I2P, Freenet
* ZeroNet
* Maidsafe

Social Networks: 

* synereo (still in development)
* diaspora (very few users)

Group Decisions (voting) on blockchain:

* BitCongress
* BitNation
* DASH masternode budget voting

Finances: alot, we plan to integrate with most of them and likely will
use OpenTransaction as a main vehicle.

## Who are your competitors and how are you different? Please include URLs

### ZeroNet https://zeronet.io/

The closest project.

Pro: already working and deployed with 200+ forks and 30+ contributors

Cons: 

* developed their own p2p network code
* hard to convert existing apps
* no built-in storage

### Maidsafe http://maidsafe.net/

Most known project to run distributed apps (after Etherium :)

Pro: 

* most known
* has a solid team
* raised funding through crowdsale

Cons:

* in development for years, yet still to release a version for public testing

### Synereo  http://www.synereo.com/

Next-get social platform

Pro:

* solid team with technical backing from Etherium 

Cons:

* focused on attention management
* underfunded (planned to raise $1.2m during crowdsale, raised ~$125K)
* no public code yet

## How many users do you currently have?

0, we're in the development stage right now

## How do you plan to acquire more users?

We see a strong grass-roots demand for an easy-to-use tool for
collective action.  That's why it would be easy to get initial groups
to use the platform. 

We see a great interest from developers side.  Since it's very easy to
convert regular web app to serve in our network, we expect a good deal
of services to be available very soon.  Initial feedback also says
that the first apps besides basic, would be content and finances .

To populate the social network part with the initial data we will
create Facebook and Twitter import scripts and apps to interact with
them from within the network.
